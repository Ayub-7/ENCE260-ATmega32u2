_________________________

Rewrite README to talk about how it runs (when it's locked in, questionmark + blue light etc).

update comments to better reflect the text.

better comments in result.h

Once all of the main changes are done, put it through astyle.
_________________________

result.c Line 53, need to mention this in the readme
game.c Line 103, It shows a questionmark when locked in, would prefer nothing
game.c Line 24 && 46, I would prefer if I didn't need to initialise the 'error' char and just leave it empty. ' ' perhaps?
__________________________

DONE IN PREVIOUS PUSH!

Show and compare results have not been merged, a function "Give result" runs both
conditions added for block vs reload
shoot is no longer visible when ammo <= 0 (NEED TO PUT INTO README THAT NO INPUT PRIOR IS INTENTIONAL SO YOU KEEP COUNT!)
cut down the code in game.c by making a function that dealt with locked in code.
