GAME EXPLANATION:

The game is similar in style to paper, scissors, rock, except
players shoot, reload and block.

If both players shoot, both are shot and the game is a draw
If one shoots and the other blocks, neither wins
If both reload or block, or a mixture of these two occur,
neither wins.
Only when one shoots and the other reloads does the game
have a victor.

The weapon however has an ammunition count, so someone cannot
indefinately shoot without repercussion.

HOW TO PLAY:

The game starts with the option to cycle between S, B, R using
the navswitch. These are Shoot, Block or Reload. Once both
players are ready, push down on the shoot button and the game
will reveal what occured with scrolling text. Reset by pushing
down. Normally, playing a best of one or a best of three is
a good idea. there is a set ammo, which is 3. if a player has
no ammo they will not have the option to shoot, they will have
to reload in order to get a shot off. if you like to play the 
game for a long time you can, it will not stop, but best of 3
is recommended.
